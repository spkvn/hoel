school project repo

Hoel is a Swinburne project for Fundamentals of Data Management. 
The subject is about data representation and databases, so I'm going to make a C.R.U.D-dy Laravel application,
which simulates a hotel (guest booking, housekeeping records etc) 

It's pretty loosey-goosey at the moment. I'll update you as we go!
